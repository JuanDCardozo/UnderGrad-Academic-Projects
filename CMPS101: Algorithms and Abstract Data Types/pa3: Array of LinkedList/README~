*****************************************************************************
How to Compile:

The Makefile should compile all the neccesary files using make. It also has a clean
functionality and a submit functionality.

*****************************************************************************
How to Run:
The only thing it should be able to function without throwing out an error is a directed
unweighted graph. It does not print the array yet.

Description of Files
scc03.c:

This program reads an input file and parses the data into an array of linked
lists in which we keep track of the vertices and the adjacent vertices to them. Then 
do a deep search first tree traversal and it will print out the information to stdout. 
This is accomplished by implmenting intList.c which is a linked list ADT.

dfsTrace1.c/dfsTrace1.h

This declares and implements the deep first search trace and then prints out the information 
for each of the vertices and edges.

loadGraph.c/loadGraph.h
It initialized the adjecency arrays and fills in the vertices and its edges.

intList.c/intList.h
ADT to create linkedLists to create adjecency 

edgeList.c/edgeList.h
Creates linkedlists with weights

dfsPhase2.c/dfsPhase2.h
*****************************************************************************
Test Files/ Input Files:

I only submitted input files, I did not do test files. There is one input file
with weights and another without weights.
