# UnderGrad-Academic-Projects
This repository contains some homeworks, projects and assginments from my undergraduate career at UCSC.

### CMPE13: Computer Systems and C Programming
Introduction to the C programming language as a means for controlling embedded and general computing systems. Continuing the exploration begun in course 12, students move to higher levels of abstraction in the control of complex computer systems. 

### CMPS12B: Introduction to Data Structures
Teaches students to implement common data structures and the algorithms associated with each data structure, through progressively difficult exercises. Topics include big "O" notation; pointers, recursion (induction), and dynamic allocation; linked lists and list processing; stacks, queues, binary trees and binary search trees; simple sorting techniques and simple search techniques. Students will gain a working knowledge of the elements of the Java and C programming languages. 

### CMPS101: Algorithms and Abstract Data Types
Studies basic algorithms and their relationships to common abstract data types. Covers the notions of abstract data types and the distinction between an abstract data type and an implementation of that data type. The complexity analysis of common algorithms using asymptotic (big "O") notation is emphasized. Topics include sorting and searching techniques, basic graph algorithms, and algorithm design techniques. Abstract data types covered include priority queues, dictionaries, disjoint sets, heaps, balanced trees, and hashing.

### CMPS121: Mobile Development
Introduces programming and application development for mobile devices. Covers the SDK and main programming platforms available on mobile devices, methodologies for developing native applications, division of computation between the mobile platform and servers, and mobile-to-server communications. Introduces platforms based on JavaScript and HTML5 for the development of applications that are portable across platforms. Students develop components of applications, leading to fully functional applications by the end of the course. Course based on emulators and SDK tools, so ownership of a cellphone/tablet is not required for the course.

### CMPS115: Software Engineering
Emphasizes the characteristics of well-engineered software systems. Topics include requirements analysis and specification, design, programming, verification and validation, maintenance, and project management. Practical and research methods are studied. Imparts an understanding of the steps used to effectively develop computer software

### CMPS183: Web Development
The World-Wde Web is one of the main mechanisms by which computer applications are delivered to users. This course introduces the design of Web applications. Students learn the main technologies involved, and build web applications as part of homework assignments and group class projects.

### CMPE107: Statistics and Probability for Engineers
Introduction to fundamental tools of stochastic analysis. Probability, conditional probability; Bayes Theorem; random variables and transforms; independence; Bernnoulli trials. Statistics, inference from limited data; outcomes of repeated experiments; applications to design; assessment of relative frequency and probability; law of large numbers; precision of measurements. Elements of stochastic processes, Poisson processes; Markov chains.

### CMPS104a: Fundamental Compiler Design I
An introduction to the basic techniques used in compiler design. Topics include compiler structure, symbol tables, regular expressions and languages, finite automata, lexical analysis, context-free languages, LL(1), recursive descent, LALR(1), and LR(1) parsing; and attribute grammars as a model of syntax-directed translation. Students use compiler building tools to construct a working compiler. 

### CMPS112: Comparative Programming Languages
Covers several programming languages and compares styles, philosophy, and design principles. Principles underlying declarative, functional, and object-oriented programming styles are studied. Students write programs emphasizing each of these techniques. 

### CMPS140: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
Introduction to the contemporary concepts and techniques of artificial intelligence, including any or all of: machine perception and inference, machine learning, optimization problems, computational methods and models of search, game playing and theorem proving. Emphasis may be on any formal method of perceiving, learning, reasoning, and problem solving which proves to be effective. This includes both symbolic and neural network approaches to artificial intelligence. Issues discussed include symbolic versus nonsymbolic methods, local versus global methods, hierarchical organization and control, and brain modeling versus engineering approaches. Lisp or Prolog may be introduced. Involves one major project or regular programming assignments.
